        "  - Artifical Intelligence (AI) is the superset which encompasses both Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).\n",
        "  - It is the technique used to process information and produce the outputs which can mimic human intelligence.\n",
        "  - Since itelligence is the attribute associated with humans only, but when you program machines to imitate that intelligence, you are actually doing what we call AI.\n",
        "  - AI can further be divided into types. \n",
        "    - Artifical General Intelligence (AGI) which is still a domain of research for scientists.\n",
        "  - Examples include alphaGo, Sophia, Siri, Google Assistant and many.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Machine Learning:\n",
        "  - Machine Learning takes one step ahead and attemps to teach machines from the data provided to them to make predictions.\n",
        "  - It is subfield of AI which makes the use of data for training the machines.\n",
        "  - It can further be divided into three categories depending upon the method of training.\n",
        "    - Supervised Learning\n",
        "    - Unspervised Learing\n",

        "## Deep Learning:\n",
        "  - Deep Learning even takes one step further from ML.\n",
        "  - It is subfield of ML and inspired by the functioning of human brain.\n",
        "  - It processes information, extracts the features automatically and predicts the output precisely.\n",
        "  - It is based on the layers and neural networks architecture.\n",
        "  - It has revolutionized the AI and ML due to follwong reasons:\n",
        "    - Big Data (Large Datasets)\n",
        "    - Hardware Advancement (GPUs/TPUs)\n",
        "    - Open Source Sofware\n",
